## 2025-02-18 - Missing Keyboard Focus States
**Learning:** Default button styles often lack clear focus indicators, making keyboard navigation difficult.
**Action:** Always include `focus-visible` styles on interactive elements, specifically `outline-none` combined with `ring-2` to ensure visibility without double borders.

## 2025-02-18 - Tactile Feedback
**Learning:** Adding `active:scale-95` provides immediate tactile feedback for clicks/taps, improving the "feel" of responsiveness.
**Action:** Apply this micro-interaction to primary and secondary actions.
